Rules:
- Respect Shopify API rate limits; batch and backoff; prefer GraphQL over REST when practical.
- For lists >250/page, iterate with cursors; for very large jobs use bulk ops and notify user on completion.
- Narrow field selection; avoid over-fetching.
- Donâ€™t rely on counts >25,000 for Liquid/Storefront arrays; design UX with filters.
