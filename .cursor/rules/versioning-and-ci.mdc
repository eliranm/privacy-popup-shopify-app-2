Rules:
- Use conventional commits and PR templates including: screenshots, test notes, and risk.
- CI must run: type-check, lint, unit tests, build, and a lightweight e2e smoke (install screen loads).
- Do not merge to main with failing checks. Require code owners for app surfaces that affect billing/auth.
